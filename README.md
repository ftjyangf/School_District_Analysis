# overall of the school district analysis
## School district has valuable infomation, maria wants to know the internal information between different category factors, and they are affecting each other. In this project, we set serval key metrics and present them in a table format and find general infomation such as average score and passing rate based on different attribute. At last, We get rid of some unreliable data, and perform same procedure and compare it with the intact data to see what we can find. 

## take off the undesired data, we took 461 data out of total 39170 data, after took the data out we find some difference

* In district data
  * we found the gerenally all the perfomance metric are improvedm such as please see the link
* In summary data 
  * the one got affected is thomas high school, there were 461 data removed,  the average score, passingrate are all changed
* In spending data 
  *the range of budget per students is between 628-645,the performance change of students in this budget range is very limited
#* in grade score analysis
  * the score of each grade goes little bit lower after removal of undesired data
* in the size grade
  * our team just find the range of size is not comparable and we are running out time, is no conclusion
* In type data
  * Nothing changed there, the reason is possiblely caused by the smaller size of change compare to the population size.
