# Overall of the school district analysis
## In this database, there are two tables. one has the information of students with their math score and reading score, and one has the schools information, such as school type and their budget. In this case, we are concentrate on students's alcademic performance based on subjects and the grade they belong to. also, we also analysize the school type, school size and school budget per student with the alcademic performance to see how those school factors affact on students' performance at school.

## At frist we took out the data might be inaccurate based on the project director information. which is 9th grade score inoformation. Second, we processed those names have prefix and suffix, so the name appearance is consistant. the passing score for both reading and math are 70, based on those information we calculate the passing rate for math, reading and both, and aggregate those information in dataframe and format it in presentable information.
